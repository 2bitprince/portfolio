# Introduction

Welcome to my very first MDX blog post. I've just set up a full markdown pipeline using **Next.js**, **next-mdx-remote**, and Let's see some rich formatting!

## Code Block Example

Here is a quick snippet demonstrating syntax highlighting with a copy button.

```tsx
"use client";

import { useState } from "react";

export function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}>
      Clicked {count} times
    </button>
  );
}
```

And here is some standard `inline code` styling to make things jump out.

> **Note**: I'm really excited to start writing more content here!

### Getting Deeper

You can also include standard markdown elements like:

- Unordered Lists
- **Bold text** or _Italic text_
- [Links](https://nextjs.org)

1. First Item
2. Second Item
3. Third Item

Thanks for checking out the setup!
